The innovation the industry talks about so much is bullshit. Anybody can innovate, it's meaningless. 99% of it is to get the work done.

All the really stressful times for me have been about process. They haven't been about code. When code doesn't work, that can actually be exciting ... Process problems are a pain in the ass.  --- [[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/15/think_different_shut_up_and_work_harder_says_linus_torvalds/][Linus Torvalds]]
