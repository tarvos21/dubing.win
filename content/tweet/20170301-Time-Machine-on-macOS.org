Using Time Machine to backup 75GB data on macOS Sierra to a 1TB Toshiba external hard drive takes about 2 hours for the first time. However, if you choose to encrypt the hard drive, if will take 24-30 hours, which is a great challengae for your patience. But, never give up, my bro, it will end at last, I have done it myself.
